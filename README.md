# Pixabay App

Simple app for searching and downloading images from different creators.

## Prerequisites

For React Native environment setup please follow [steps in official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Installation and Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Navigate to that repository direction
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` (I prefer to use this one)

For **Android Platform** you need to only run `npm react-native run-android` 
  or if you're using yarn `yarn android` in your terminal

For **iOS Platform** you need to do one more step
- Navigate to `/ios` directory
- Run `pod install`
- Go back to the root of you project (most commonly `cd ../`)
- `npm react-native run-ios` or `yarn ios` if you're using yarn

In some reasons time by time metro bundler server maybe not to start, 
  so you can open new terminakl tab or window at the project directory and run
  `npm start` command
